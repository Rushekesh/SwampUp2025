# Lab 1: OSS Filtering using Curated Remote Repo
Welcome to the SwampUp 2025 hands-on lab for JFrog Curation! This lab will guide you through the process of setting up and using Curation to control the open-source software (OSS) that enters your organization's software supply chain.

JFrog Curation is a powerful tool that allows you to establish automated policies to approve or block OSS packages from public repositories based on security vulnerabilities, license compliance, and other custom conditions. This lab will walk you through a common use case: blocking a package that has GPL license and then managing a developer's request for an exception.

## Prerequisites
- Before you start, make sure you have the following ready:
- JFrog CLI: Installed and configured in your shell's PATH.
- JFrog Platform Access: You'll need the URL and login credentials for your JFrog instance.
- Lab Files: You should have the lab scripts checked out locally.
- JFrog Platform UI credentials
    - username: ``` admin ```
    - Password: ``` Admin1234! ```

## Navigate to the IDE UI
First, let's set up the necessary repositories using a script.

### Navigate to the Lab Directory
First, let's set up the necessary repositories using a script in the IDE terminal and change to the lab directory.
```
cd ~/jfrog/JFTD-114-Compliant_SDLC_Without_Compromise/LAB-1
```

### Create Repositories
Run the setup script to automatically create Gradle repositories in Artifactory.
````
    ./setup-repos.sh
````
This script will create the remote, local, and virtual repositories needed for the lab.

##  JFrog Platform UI - Curation

### Enabling
Now, let's enable Curation in the JFrog Platform UI.
- Navigate to the *Administration* module, then go to **Curation** -> **General**.
- Toggle the switch to turn Curation On.

- Click on Enable repositories.

<img src="./images/lab1-curation-2.png" /><br/>

- Select the maven package type to enable Curation for all remote repositories of that type.

### Creating a Curation Condition
Conditions are the building blocks of Curation policies. Let's create a condition to specifically block **GPL 3.0 license packages**

- Navigate to **Administration** >> **Curation Settings** and select the Conditions tab.
- Click **Create Condition.**

- On Create Custom Condition from Template,
    - Select Custom condition templates: ``` Package license in banned license list ```
    - Condition name: ``` block-license-gpl3orlater ```
    - Select banned licenses: ``` GPL-3.0-or-later ```

### Creating a Curation Policy
Policies apply conditions to specific repositories.

- Navigate to Curation -> Policies and create a new policy.
- Configure the policy to use the ```  block-license-gpl3orlater ```  condition on your remote ``` jftd114-lab1-mvn-remote ```  repository. Set the action to Block and allow for Manually approved waivers.
	- Policy Name: ``` block-gpl3orlater-policy ```
	- Select Scope as *Select Remote Repositories*: ``` jftd114-lab1-mvn-remote ```
	- Policy Condition: ``` block-license-gpl3orlater ```
	- Actions & Notifications: ``` Block ```
	- Configure the waiver request options for blocked packages: ``` Manually approved ```
	- Owner Groups: ``` sup_admin ```

    <img src="./images/lab1-curation-policy-0.png" /> <br/>

## IDE Terminal - Developer Requesting a Curation Waiver
The developer uses the `jf ca` command to check if their app dependencies violate any Curation policies before attempting to download them.

```
cd java-app
```

The output will show that the package is blocked by the 'blocked-log4j-policy' policy. Because the policy is configured to allow manual waivers, the developer is prompted to request one.

- Request the Waiver: The developer follows the interactive prompts in the CLI to select the package and provide a justification for the waiver.
- Execute the jfcli.sh script from IDE terminal:
```
./jfcli.sh
```

- This script will perform the following sequence of actions:
- Maven config with virtual repo
```
jf mvnc ...
```

- Curation Audit
```
	jf ca  ...
```

## JFrog Platform UI: Reviewing and Approving the Curation Waiver request
The designated approver (a member of the sup-admin group) manages the request in the JFrog Platform.

- The approver receives a notification and navigates to the waiver management interface (**Platform** >> **Curation**  >> **Waivers Requests**) to see the pending request.

<img src="./images/lab1-policy-approve-3.png" /><br/>

- They can review the package details, the developer's justification, and the policies that are blocking it.
- Upon approval, the label is automatically applied to the package in the **Platform** >> **Catalog**  >> **Labels**, making it available for download.

After approval, the developer can successfully resolve and download the dependency into their project. ðŸŽ‰
- Navigate back to IDE terminal and execute the ``` ./jfcli.sh ``` command
